# Referral FAQ ​


## How do I refer my friends to WeWeb? ​

Just share your unique referral link, which you can find in your Referral Dashboard:



All your friends will need to do is click on that link, and they'll be guided through the sign-up process.


## What is the referral link? ​

The referral link is an easy way to share WeWeb with others. Rewarding your friends for trying WeWeb and you for making a successful referral.


## How much do I get paid by participating in the WeWeb Referral Program? ​

WeWeb current promotion pays a 10% referral to you and 10% discount incentive to your potential referral.

WeWeb Agency plan holders receive a 20% referral and 10% discount incentive to any self-serve plans available via the billing portal. (Note: Enterprise plans do not include discounts).

WeWeb pays the referral % as long as the new customer is subscribed to a WeWeb paid plan with a maximum payout time frame of 12 months (Note: Agency plan holders do not have a 12 month limitation on payout timeframes).

When calculating the amount receivable by you, we deduct our Stripe fees of 4%. As an example, if you refer us a customer who subscribes to a monthly scale plan, you will be eligible to 10% or 20% of $179 x (1 - 4%) = 10% or 20% of $171,84.


## What is considered a successful referral? ​

Standard Referral

A referral is successful when:

- A user new to WeWeb signs up using your unique referral link, and...
- Successfully pays a minimum of one month’s subscription.
- Both referrer and referee are not the same entity or person.


## How will I know when I've successfully referred someone? ​

You can track the status of your referrals directly from your Referral dashboard.


## My referral forgot to use my referral link. Is there a way to track it back to my account? ​

We’re unable to track referrals back to your account if they did not use your referral link at the time they signed up.


## When and how will I get paid? ​

- You will be eligible for payment once your referral has been a paid WeWeb customer with a maturity date of 30 days and a minimum payout of $100.
- Once you’re eligible for your first payment, you can request for payment on your referral dashboard.


## Some users have no subscriptions - what does that mean? ​

If a user doesn’t have any subscriptions, it just means they are a free account. This information is still useful because free accounts have the potential to convert into paid subscriptions.
