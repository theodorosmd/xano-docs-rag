# Understanding WeWeb pricing ​

WeWeb offers two distinct types of plans that serve different purposes - seat plans and hosting plans.

A seat plan is required to add a hosting plan. Hosting plans cannot be purchased standalone—you'll need at least an Essential seat plan first.


## Plan types ​


### Seat plans ​

Seat plans determine what building capabilities you have access to within the WeWeb editor. These plans control the number of developer seats (users who can access the WeWeb editor), access to specific WeWeb features for building applications, AI token allocation, and code export and self-hosting capabilities.

The seat plan tiers are Free, Essential, Pro, and Partner.


### Hosting plans ​

Hosting plans, available starting from the Essential seat plan, determine how you can deploy and share your WeWeb applications with others. These plans control where your application can be hosted (WeWeb subdomain or custom domain), bandwidth and traffic limitations, branding options, and application session limits.

The hosting plan tiers are Free, Launch, Grow, and Scale.


## Feature explanations ​


### Code export & self-hosting ​

What it is: This feature allows you to download the code of your WeWeb project and host it on your own infrastructure.

Availability: Available on Essential seat plan and higher

Key benefits: Self-hosting gives you the ability to deploy your application on your own servers without WeWeb hosting limitations (bandwidth, sessions, etc.), complete control over your application's hosting environment, and the ability to integrate with your own DevOps processes.

TIP

Self-hosting gives you complete control but also means you're responsible for your own infrastructure, scalability, and security.


### AI tokens ​

What they are: AI tokens are used when interacting with WeWeb's AI features to generate content, logic, or designs.

How they work: Each seat plan includes a specific monthly allocation of AI tokens that are consumed when using AI-powered features. Different AI operations consume different amounts of tokens.

WARNING

AI tokens reset monthly and don't roll over. Plan your AI usage accordingly to avoid running out of tokens before your renewal date.


### Seats ​

What they are: Seats represent individual user accounts that can access the WeWeb editor to build applications.

How they work: Each seat allows one user to access the WeWeb editor and are assigned to specific team members. Different seat plans allow different numbers of seats, with some plans charging per seat while others include a set number of seats.


### App sessions ​

What they are: App sessions represent individual user interactions with your published WeWeb application.

How they work: Each time a user visits your application, it counts as a session. Hosting plans have different limits on the number of monthly sessions, though when self-hosting, app session limits don't apply.


### Price per seat ​

What it is: This pricing model charges based on the number of developers who need access to the WeWeb editor.

How it works: You pay for each individual who needs to build applications in WeWeb. Different seat plans have different per-seat pricing, with some plans including a set number of seats in the base price.


### Unlimited seats ​

What it is: Some plans allow an unlimited number of developers to access the WeWeb editor.

How it works: Everyone on your team can build applications without additional seat charges. This is typically available on higher-tier plans.


### Export code & self-host ​

What it is: The ability to download your WeWeb project's code and deploy it elsewhere.

How it works: You can export your project as compiled code ready for deployment and host on any web server or cloud platform, bypassing WeWeb's hosting limitations. This feature is available on Essential seat plan and higher.


## Choosing the right plans ​

You'll need both a seat plan and a hosting plan (unless you're self-hosting). First, choose your seat plan based on how many developers need to build applications and what features you need access to. Next, select your hosting plan based on your traffic needs, custom domain requirements, and white-labeling needs. If you plan to self-host, you can choose any seat plan that includes code export (Essential or higher), and you won't need a WeWeb hosting plan.


## FAQs ​


### Do I need both a seat plan and a hosting plan? ​

Yes, unless you're self-hosting. The seat plan gives you access to build applications, while the hosting plan allows you to publish them on WeWeb's infrastructure.


### If I self-host, do I still need a hosting plan? ​

No. If you export your code and host it on your own infrastructure, you don't need a WeWeb hosting plan. However, you'll still need an appropriate seat plan (Essential or higher) that includes the code export feature.


### Which countries offer regional pricing? ​

Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, and Thailand. Customers in these countries can subscribe to WeWeb in their local currency. The regional discount will be applied directly on the pricing page.


### Can I transfer my plan to other projects? ​

Plans cannot be transferred between projects. If you need to move to a different project, simply cancel your current plan and subscribe to a new one for your desired project.


### What happens if I exceed my hosting plan limits? ​

If you exceed your monthly app sessions or bandwidth limits, you may experience throttling or temporary service interruptions. You can upgrade your hosting plan or consider self-hosting options.


### Can I mix different plan tiers for seat and hosting plans? ​

Yes, you can choose different tiers for your seat and hosting plans based on your specific needs. For example, you might have a Pro seat plan but a Launch hosting plan.

TIP

When your application is in development, you might need a higher-tier seat plan but can use a lower-tier hosting plan. When launching to production, you might need to increase your hosting plan tier while maintaining the same seat plan.
