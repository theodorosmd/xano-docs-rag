# Stripe â€‹

Let's see how you can setup Stripe in WeWeb so that your web-app users can make payments.


## Configure the plugin â€‹

To add the Stripe Plugin to your WeWeb project, go to the Plugins > Extensions menu:

`Plugins > Extensions`


Once you have added the Stripe Extension, you will be invited to set it up with your production API keys:



TIP

If you want to work with test data in Stripe, you can also add test API keys. Better be safe than sorry! ðŸ˜…


## Add a payment form â€‹

Once you have set up the Stripe plugin, you will have access to the payment form element.

To display a Stripe payment form on your web app, you'll need to add a Form Container with a submit button:

`Form Container`


Then, you'll want to remove the input so you're only left with the button element and add the Stripe - Payment element inside the form container you added above:

`Stripe - Payment`


In the Stripe payment element's Settings, you'll need a client secret:

`Settings`



### Create client intent & client secret workflow â€‹

To get a client secret, we first need to create a client intent. We do this by creating a workflow that triggers on page load.

In the first step, we create a payment intent, decide which payment methods the client can use and which Stripe products they can purchase (the Price ID will come from your Stripe account):

`Price ID`


We will then test Action 1 because we need to bind its result in Action 2.

In step two, we setup a Change variable value action to update a payment_intent_client_secret variable (type Query) with the value of client_secret in the result of the previous action:

`Change variable value`
`payment_intent_client_secret`
`client_secret`


TIP

The query variable must be named payment_intent_client_secret in WeWeb because that's the name of the query string Stripe will pass when creating the client secret. If you choose a different name in WeWeb, the browser won't be able to recognize the query string provided by Stripe.

`payment_intent_client_secret`
Once our workflow triggered on page load is complete, we will go back to our Stripe - Payment element and bind the payment_intent_client_secret variable to the Client secret setting:

`Stripe - Payment`
`payment_intent_client_secret`
`Client secret`



### Confirm payment workflow â€‹

Finally, on the form container, we will trigger a workflow On submit to confirm the payment action and redirect the user to a checkout page when they submit the payment form:

`On submit`



### Fake payment â€‹

In order to move forward with the tutorial, you will need to fake a payment intent with a fake card. Read more about simulating payments in the Stripe documentation.

Once you've entered fake payment details, you can submit the form to trigger the workflow:



You should be redirected to the checkout page.


## Add a checkout page â€‹

On the checkout page, we'll create a workflow that triggers on page to retrieve the user's payment intent:


### Action 1: Retrieve the payment intent â€‹

We will add the Retrieve payment intent action and bind this to the payment_intent_client_secret variable we created earlier.

`Retrieve payment intent`
`payment_intent_client_secret`
It will look something like this:



If you've named your variable correctly and faked a payment with a fake Stripe card, you should be able to see the the payment_intent_client_secret query string in the URL, which is retrieved by WeWeb in the payment_intent_client_secret variable:

`payment_intent_client_secret`
`payment_intent_client_secret`



### Action 2: Store the payment intent â€‹

After testing Action 1, we will create an Action 2 to store the payment intent in a variable of type Object.

We will choose a Change variable value action and bind it to the result of the previous action in the workflow:

`Change variable value`


Again, we need to test this action if we want to update the variable.

Then, we could use the information from the variable to style the checkout page.

For example:




## Before publishing â€‹

When you publish your application, the Stripe - payment element will not be rendered on the page by default because it can only be rendered if a payment intent is found and, when the browser first loads the page, the client intent will not have been created yet.

`Stripe - payment`
In order to ensure the Stripe payment element is rendered on the page, you'll need to bind it's Conditional rendering setting to the payment_intent_client_secret variable:

`Conditional rendering`
`payment_intent_client_secret`


That way, when the workflow is triggered on page load and the payment intent variable updated with the client secret, the Stripe payment element will be rendered on the page.
