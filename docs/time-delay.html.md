# Time delay ​

The Time delay action pauses your workflow execution for a specified duration before continuing to the next action.

`Time delay`
Required field:

Time (ms): The duration to pause in milliseconds

`Time (ms)`
If you set the time to 1000, the workflow will pause for 1 second before proceeding to the next action.

Use time delays when you need to introduce intentional pauses in your workflow, such as showing loading states, handling animations, or ensuring sequential timing of actions.
