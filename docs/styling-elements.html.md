# Styling your elements ​

Once you've added elements to your page, the next step is to style them to match your design vision. WeWeb provides a visual way to apply CSS properties without writing code.


## Accessing the styling panel ​

To style an element:

- select any element on your canvas
- look for the Styling tab in the right panel (the pen icon)
- use the available options to customize the element's appearance

`Styling`



## Understanding style categories ​

The styling panel is organized into several categories:


### Specific ​

This section shows the most commonly used properties for the selected element type. Different elements will show different options here, such as:

- typography settings for text elements
- image fit options for images
- direction settings for containers


### Text ​

Options for controlling text appearance:

- font family and size
- text color and decoration
- line height and letter spacing
- text alignment and transformation


### Sizing ​

Control the dimensions of your element:

- width and height
- minimum and maximum constraints
- responsive sizing options


### Spacing ​

Manage the space around and within elements:

- padding (space inside the element)
- margin (space outside the element)


### Display ​

Control how elements appear and behave:

- position (relative, absolute, fixed)
- visibility and opacity
- z-index (stacking order)
- overflow handling


### Background ​

Add visual backgrounds to elements:

- background colors
- background images or gradients


### Borders & shadows ​

Define the edges and depth of elements:

- border width, style, and color
- border radius (rounded corners)
- box shadows for depth


### Advanced ​

For more sophisticated styling:

- transformations (rotate, scale, skew)
- transitions for animations
- custom CSS

## Responsive styling ​

WeWeb makes it easy to create designs that look great on all devices:

- use the breakpoint selector in the top bar to switch between desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- when in a mobile or tablet view, any styling changes will apply only to that specific breakpoint
- use percentage widths and max-width constraints for fluid layouts
