## Why use CSS grids â€‹

CSS grids are a powerful tool to build complex, responsive layouts on the web.

For example, designing a complex layout like this would be complex with a flex display but is fairly easy with a grid display:

UNDERSTANDING CSS GRID BASICS

The following article aims to explain how to use CSS grid properties in the WeWeb editor.

If you're new to CSS grids, we recommend you take the time to understand how CSS grids work in general.

We have selected 4 free resources that can help you with this:

- Learn CSS Grid helpfully lists and illustrates all available grid CSS properties
- CSS Grid Garden is an fun, interactive way to understand CSS grid properties
- MDN's docs explains the basic concepts of grid layouts
- Grid by Example includes numerous examples of grid layouts with the underlying HTML & CSS to reverse-engineer how each was built


## Grid container â€‹

In the Style tab of WeWeb containers, you will find grid and inline-grid under the Display property options:

`Style`
`grid`
`inline-grid`
`Display`


When a container has a grid or inline-grid display, all the children of that container become grid items.

`grid`
`inline-grid`
Learn more about the grid container.


## Grid direction â€‹

Grids can have a horizontal ("row") or vertical ("columns") direction:



In the example above, we have 3 containers that can be displayed as rows or columns.


## Grid column & row size â€‹

By default, each column or row will have the same width and height respectively.

You can, however, be explicit and set a fixed width or height to create more complex layouts:



In CSS, this corresponds to the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties.

`grid-template-rows`
`grid-template-columns`
In WeWeb, you have a couple of options to work with these properties:

- use the no-code interface of WeWeb as shown in the columns example above, or
- bind the Rows or Columns settings in WeWeb to CSS values as shown in the rows example below.

`Rows`
`Columns`


In the example above, you can see we have an array of 5 values that defines the height of the 5 rows in our grid.

## Grid gaps â€‹

Grid gaps (also called "gutters") are an elegant way of handling spacing:

## Grid items span & position â€‹

For each item in a grid, you can define its:

- span: how many row or column units does it span,
- position: where should it be placed in the row or column

Let's look at a few examples.


### Example 1 â€‹



In both cases, the grid container is configured as follows:

- Direction: Row
- Columns: auto-generated
- Rows: auto-generated
- Width: 100%
- Height: 500px

`Direction`
`Columns`
`Rows`
`Width`
`Height`
The grid on the left has no additional settings on the grid items. The grid on the right contains grid items where we specified the span or position.


### Example 2 â€‹



In all three cases, the grid container is configured as follows:

- Direction: Column
- Columns: 3 columns of 1fr
- Rows: 3 rows of 1fr
- Width: 100%
- Height: auto

`Direction`
`Columns`
`1fr`
`Rows`
`1fr`
`Width`
`Height`
The grid at the top has no additional settings on the grid items.

Grid item A of the middle grid has a Column position of 2/4.

`Column position`
`2/4`
Grid item A of the bottom grid has a Row span of 2 and a Column position of 2/4.

`Row span`
`2`
`Column position`
`2/4`
TIP

In the example above, notice that each grid has 4 vertical lines.

When we give the Column position property a 2/4 value, it means that the grid item should take up the space between vertical line 2 and vertical line 4 in the grid.

`Column position`
`2/4`
