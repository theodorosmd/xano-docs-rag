# Using the Add Panel ​


## Add an element on the page ​

The Add panel is where you can find UI blocks to add to your web application. These can be anything, from simple texts to complex forms.

`Add`
To add an element to your app, simply drag and drop it where needed in your app:



The Add panel is composed of different sections, let's discover each category:

`Add`

## Basics ​

## Custom Coded Components ​

Here is where you will find all the available custom coded components that have been added to your project:

You can either have AI generate your custom coded components, or code them yourself.

TIP

All the native WeWeb elements available in the Basics tab are actually just custom coded components that have been created by the WeWeb team.

`Basics`
All our native elements are public and available in our Github.


## Multi-page sections ​

This is where you will find the list of existing sections in your app:

- Linked sections: lists all the sections that are linked on multiple pages in your app.
- Pages: lists all the pages in your app with all the sections (linked or not) on each page.



From this panel, you can drag-and-drop a section on a page. When you drop a section on a page, you will be prompted to decide if you want to Create an instance or Create a copy of that section:

`Create an instance`
`Create a copy`


THE POWER OF MULTI PAGE SECTIONS

When you create an instance of a section, it is also called a "Linked section" or a "Multi-page section".

The changes you make on one instance of a linked section will be reflected on all other instances of this section, throughout the app.

## Plugin UI kits ​

Here, you'll find elements that are specific to the plugins you installed.

For example: authentication forms for auth plugins, charts, maps, etc.

In the example above, the elements available are those from the charts plugin.
