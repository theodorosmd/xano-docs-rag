# Publishing your application ​

After building your WeWeb application, the final step is to publish it so others can access it. This guide will walk you through the basics of the deployment process.


## Deploying to production ​

To deploy your project live while in the editor:

- Click Deploy in the top right
- Click Publish To WeWeb Subdomain
- Give your publish a descriptive name
- Click Publish & Promote
- Your project will now deploy

`Deploy`
`Publish To WeWeb Subdomain`
`Publish & Promote`

## Deploying to staging ​

SCALE PLAN REQUIRED

Staging deployment is only available on the Scale or higher hosting plans. If you're on the Starter plan, you'll only be able to publish directly to production.

To deploy to a staging environment:

- Click Deploy in the top right
- Click Publish to staging only
- Give your publish a descriptive name
- Click Publish
- Your project will now deploy to staging

`Deploy`
`Publish to staging only`
`Publish`

## Accessing previous versions ​

If you ever need to access a previous version of your project:

- Go into the settings of your project
- Go to the Backups tab
- Expand the day you wish to view
- Preview the previous version or rollback to a previous version

`Backups`
