# Project settings ​

To access a project's settings, go to your WeWeb dashboard and click on the Settings button next to the project name:

`Settings`


In a project's settings, you will find 6 tabs:

- Deployments
- Domain
- Backups
- Self-hosting
- Plans
- Settings

In addition, you will be able to open the project in safe mode.


## Deployments ​

In the Deployments tab, you will be able to:

`Deployments`
- publish your app,
- preview a previous version of the Editor,
- rollback to a previous version of the Editor.

## Backups ​

In the Backups tab of a project, you can see all the different versions of the Editor that you can potentially rollback to.

`Backups`

## Self-Hosting ​

See documentation on self-hosting here.


## Plans ​

The Plans tab is where you can upgrade or downgrade your pricing plan according to your projects' needs.

`Plans`
For example, if you're ready to publish and want to move away from the Free plan.


## Settings ​

In the Settings tab, you can:

`Settings`
- Change the project name
- Setup a webhook that will get POSTed to when the app is pushed to production
- Delete the project (beware, this will be permanent and we won't be able to recover your project)




## Safe mode ​

If your app crashes or behaves strangely when you open a project in the Editor, we recommend opening the project in safe mode.

To open a project in safe mode, you'll:

- need to be on the Projects tab of your WeWeb workspace,
- click on the Settings of the project you want to debug,
- click on the three dots icon next to the Open Editor button, and
- choose if you want to debug with workflows and/or formulas disabled

`Projects`
`Settings`
`Open Editor`


This will allow you to test your project:

- with all workflows disabled, or
- with all workflows and formulas disabled.

This can help you identify what you need to debug in your app.
