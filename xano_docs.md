# Best Practices

Source: https://docs.xano.com/security/best-practices

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by **JWE** tokens, which is an industry standard.

**Authentication** is how a user logs in or signs up to an application. Xano provides secure out-of-the-box authentication via JWE (JSON Web Encryption) tokens. JWE tokens are self-contained and provide data integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality.

**OAuth**, which stands for “**Open Authorization**,”allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password**.**

**OAuth** providers such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and GitHub login are available in the Xano marketplace to easily enable.

## Single-Tenancy

On Xano's dedicated resource plans, the user's Instance is on a single-tenant deployment or architecture. This means that the user is the only tenant on the server (Instance) architecture and that all the server resources and CPU are dedicated to the tenant. Single-tenancy has a variety of benefits including:

**Data Separation** - Data is kept separate from other users since the Instance is isolated. This allows for independence of data and greater customization of software and hardware.

**Data Security** - If one user has a breach of data, then another user is safe from the breach since their data is stored on a completely separate Instance.

**Reliability & Performance** - Since the Instance is only dependent and serves a single tenant, performance and reliability are significantly increased. The alternative would be the Instance serving many different users.

**Recovery** - With a single-tenancy backups are also isolated, making it easier and more reliable to restore from backups in the event of a disaster.

## Password Requirements

Xano requires password minimums for logging in to a Xano account. A password must be a minimum of eight (8) characters, maximum of 256 characters, at least one (1) alphabetic character, and at least one (1) numeric character. These password requirements are only for login by email and password.

Password requirements for Single Sign-On (SSO) are managed by the SSO provider.

## 2FA Security

Two-factor authentication (2FA) security, or two-step authentication, can be enabled for logging in to a Xano account. 2FA security requires the use of two different forms of identification to access and authenticate an account. It is an extra layer of security beyond email and password credentials that secures an account by requiring an authentication step from something that belongs to the user.

## Inactivity Timeout

To protect your privacy, Xano includes an inactivity timer which will log you out after 2 hours of inactivity by default, but this can be adjusted or disabled entirely via your account settings. This is based on mouse activity and works across multiple tabs.

## Enforcement

On certain Xano plans, you have the ability to enable security policy enforcement through your Instance settings.

**Require 2FA** enforces that your users not only have two-factor authentication enabled, but that they have logged in using that method.

**Authentication Enforcement** enables requiring your team members to authenticate using one or more of the enabled services you choose.

**Allowed SSO Hosts** enforces the email address domains allowed when team members log in. As an example, if we wanted our team members to only authenticate using Github accounts that use a xano.com email address, we could check Github under Authentication Enforcement, and add xano.com as an allowed SSO host.

## Sensitive Data Flagging

The **sensitive data** flag only impacts the inputs of a request when using database link, which automatically creates inputs for you based on database fields; you will want to ensure that the sensitive data is not returned elsewhere in your function stack.

In the settings for the field you would like to hide, enable the **Sensitive Data** flag.

**Sensitive Data Flag - Disabled**

**Sensitive Data Flag - Enabled**

# Relationships

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-database/database-basics/relationships

**Quick Definition**

Database relationships show how different tables of data connect to each other - like how a customer's ID links their personal information to their complete order history. These relationships can be one-to-one (one person, one social security number), one-to-many (one customer, many orders), or many-to-many (many students can take many classes).

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Types of Relationships

In Xano, there are three primary ways tables can be related:

## 1. One-to-One

This is like a person and their unique passport. Each data entry in one table relates to exactly one entry in another table.

## 2. One-to-Many

Think of a parent and their children. A single entry in one table can relate to multiple entries in another. For example, one teacher can teach many students.

## 3. Many-to-Many

Similar to students enrolling in various courses, any entry in one table can relate to multiple entries in another.

---

## ❓ Why Use Relationships?

* **Data Consistency**: Ensures all references are valid.
* **Reduced Redundancy**: Minimizes repeated data.
* **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Makes it easier to access related data.

Understanding these basic concepts can simplify how you view databases and highlight why tools like Xano are powerful for managing data.

---

## 👀 Using the Table Reference Field Type

When you add a table reference field to a database table, that field simply stores the IDs of the record(s) being referenced; the data is not actually duplicated. To access the actual data is typically done via an add-on as part of a function stack.

## Auto-Complete

Auto-Complete allows you to configure how the referenced records look inside of other tables.

For this example, we have two tables: `user` and `userRole`

1

## Navigate to the table you are referencing data from to adjust the Auto-Complete settings.

2

3

## Click 'Customize' if this is your first time enabling Auto-Complete customization on this table.

4

## Click 'Add Column' to add a new field that will appear on tables that reference this one.

# Storage

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-database/database-performance-and-maintenance/storage

Database storage uses high-performance solid-state drives (SSD). This storage is used only for the database schema, the metadata of each database record, and the indexes on the metadata. Any media references in the database records would be metadata only as the actual binary of this media is stored in separate media storage.

## Explaining Database Usage

In Xano, your data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which allows for incredibly powerful structure, scalability, and speed. In your dashboard, you have the ability to see exactly how much of your database storage is occupied, to help guide you in making decisions about what data to keep, or if it’s time to upgrade your instance with more storage to suit your needs.

Database storage is different from file storage. Think of a folder on your computer that you delete a file inside of. When you do this, your computer doesn’t immediately destroy the data – that file is hidden from you, marked as inaccessible, and the storage that file occupies is now marked as available. Your computer then calculates the available storage, taking this newly available space into account. This all happens in real time.

Now, in terms of a database, where your Xano data is stored, deleting a row does not immediately remove this row from your storage. This approach is required to ensure that things like versioning and backups can still continue to function, and to account for anything else that may still be accessing that data. Eventually, that data will not be relevant to any operation, and the space it occupies must then be reclaimed for reuse by new rows. This is something that occurs on your workspace at regular intervals with scheduled maintenance.

## I deleted some records, but my storage is still the same. What’s going on?

As stated above, when records are removed, to support certain Xano features, as well as by design on the PostgreSQL database, that space is not immediately going to be marked as available and computed in your storage statistics – however, eventually the space those records were occupying will be reused when adding new records. In addition, it’s important to remember when considering this that a database table with 1000 records, that has had 999 of them deleted, is not the same in terms of structure or storage requirements as a brand new table with only one record.

## My storage usage doesn’t seem to be updating.

Your storage statistics are updated at regular intervals throughout the day, and are not real-time. We’d love to be able to offer more control over data architecture and maintenance in the future, and if that’s something you are looking for, make sure to let us know on our feature request board.

## What is actually taking up database storage?

There are several different components that make up your Xano database, and they can all contribute to database storage.

This includes:

* Database table schema
  *What fields you've set and the settings that accompany them*
* Records
  *This is your actual data that you are storing in your database.*
* Indexes
  *Some indexes are auto-generated and required to maintain your table. Others are manually added by you, and can take up a varying amount of space.*
* Task and Request History
  *When you make requests to your Xano APIs or run background tasks, this history is logged on a 24-hour rolling cycle. Sometimes, if you have an exceptional amount of history, this will be reflected as used database storage, as it is stored in a similar fashion to your database records behind the scenes.*

# Data Types

# Middleware

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/building-with-visual-development/middleware

Middleware offers powerful functionality to control the behavior of your APIs at pivotal points of execution.

All plans include **one** instance of middleware at no charge.

Our **Scale** and higher plans include unlimited middleware.

## What is middleware?

Middleware are separate pieces of logic that you build in Xano that can run before your API executes (even before input validation) or after your function stack is finished executing but before your API delivers its response.

Middleware can be applied at an API, API group, or workspace level. This means that you can apply the same middleware functionality to multiple API endpoints, or even your entire application, in one swing. You also have the ability to customize the middleware application at an API or API group level, meaning that if you want to apply your middleware to your entire application *except* a certain API or group, you can do that too.

Middleware offers the same functionality that any other function stack can utilize.

---

## Middleware Availability

Middleware is available in both **free** and **paid** versions.

**Free Version**

All of our paid plans can utilize the free version of Middleware. In the free version, you can create one Middleware function stack to assign as you see fit across your workspace.

**Paid Version**

The paid version of Middleware is included with our Scale plan. The premium version allows for unlimited creation and assignment of Middleware on APIs, functions, or tasks. Additional defaults are supported at the API group level, which can either be customized or inherited from workspace defaults.

If your plan includes the Compliance Center, you'll also be able to access reporting on middleware usage from there.

---

## How does middleware work?

## Types of Middleware

**Pre-Middleware**

Pre-middleware executes before any input validation takes place. For example, if you have one of your inputs built in such a way that it requires a minimum string length, your pre-middleware won't be aware of this.

## Note

Pre-middleware will only surface **defined** inputs from the API it is attached to. This means for endpoints where the payload is unpredictable, you will need to ensure that all inputs are defined in the API.

**Post-Middleware**

Post-middleware executes after the function stack ends, but before the API delivers a response. The output of the middleware can be merged into the response your API generates, or replace it entirely.

## Building Middleware

Once you've added your middleware, you can begin building your logic, just like any other function stack. There are a couple of key differences to be aware of, however.

* **Inputs**

  + Middleware inputs are static and can not be changed. They will automatically contain the variables coming from the parent object. This means that for pre-middleware, the parent object will provide the inputs contained in the API request. For post-middleware, this will be your API response.
  + When referencing those inputs, you will do so from inside the `vars` variable. So, if you send an input labeled `text`, you'd reference this inside a middleware stack using `vars.text`
  + The type contains whether this is running as pre or post middleware, and can not be changed.
* **Response**

  + Middleware responses have the option to either merge or replace the response in the parent object.

    - **Merge** means that middleware will generate its response and merge it with the response of the parent object. For example, if my API contains an input called `text` and my pre-middleware generates a variable called number, and my response type is set to **merge**, we could use a Get All Input function to retrieve those additional inputs. **Merge** also means that any items in the response that have the same name as your inputs will be replaced in the process, as you can not have two keys in a JSON object of the same name.
    - **Replace** means that your middleware will essentially ignore all of the inputs given to it **when it generates a response**. For example, if I am building pre-middleware, and I send it an input called 'text', and it does not deliver that in the response, that 'text' input will no longer be available in the API's function stack.
* **Exception Preferences**

  + **Silent** ignores errors thrown in middleware and allows the API to return the response without returning the error encountered
  + **Rethrow** allows post-middleware to execute for the purposes of error logging in your pre-middleware
  + **Critical** halts all execution if an error occurs

For this example, we'll be using the following middleware:

...with the following API:

The middleware is responsible for checking the 'text' API to determine if it has a value of "Hello" before allowing access.

After you've built your middleware, you're ready to apply it.

## Applying Middleware

## **Applying Middleware to your Entire Workspace**

1

2

## Select the workflow type to apply the middleware to.

You can choose from APIs, Functions, or Tasks.

3

## Apply PRE or POST middleware.

4

## **Applying Middleware to an API Group or Single API**

Middleware applications are inherited from their parent object. This means that any middleware you apply at a workspace level will be populated down to each API group and API. You do have the ability to customize the middleware on API groups and individual APIs for more granular control over the middleware that applies to that workflow.

Just click the settings icon inside of an API group or API, choose Middleware, and check the Customize box to update the middleware for that specific group or API.

## Why use Middleware?

## Flexibility

Middleware can be much more flexible in certain scenarios, such as input validation. While Xano currently offers several basic filters for input validation, such as enforcing a certain number of characters, middleware offers the power of an entire function stack to not only validate those inputs in new ways, but even transform and manipulate them, should the need arise.

## Build Efficiency

One of the key benefits to using middleware, as opposed to using a custom function for example, is the methods at which middleware can be applied. Having the ability to insert both PRE and POST middleware in your function stacks offers more versatile and controlled execution of the logic contained within them.

Not only that, Middleware can also be applied at a workspace or API group level, giving you a one-swing approach to applying middleware to all of your API endpoints at once, instead of having to go through each API one at a time to apply a custom function.

# Working with Data

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/building-with-visual-development/working-with-data

## Understanding Working with Data

When we talk about working with data in Xano, we are referring to anything that touches a piece of data in your workflows — whether it is an API, custom function, task, or anything else. Data will typically always be passing through these workflows, and it's important to understand the various ways you can access and interact with this data.

## Database vs Variables

The **database** is used to store information that you will need to recall again later, and across workflows, such as:

* User accounts
* Product and order information
* Blog posts or comments

**Variables** are used inside of individual workflows to store information temporarily that you only need to finish the set of functions being executed, such as:

* The current date / time
* Data from a database that needs temporary manipulation or transformation, such as combining a first and last name or calculating a discount
* The output of individual functions in a function stack, like getting a record from a database table

## Data in Functions

Most functions that you can add to a function stack will have some kind of output available. The output of these functions are stored in a **variable**.

In the screenshot shown below, we are using a get record function to retrieve a record from our `author` table. On the right side of that function, take note of return as **author1**. This is the variable that the record we retrieve is stored in, and what we will use to get that data in subsequent functions.

When we add another function, we can reference **author1** as shown below.

## Data in Filters

Filters are like mini-functions that can ride alongside other functions in your function stack. They are used to perform a wide array of tasks against a piece of data.

Our current function stack does nothing but retrieve a record from our `author` table.

Let's transform this data by changing the author's name to uppercase. The simplest of data transformation happens in an **Update Variable** function. Try it for yourself below.

## Changing Variable Names

As you build your function stacks, you'll want to ensure you are naming variables appropriately, so you can understand what they contain.

When adding a function, you'll usually have the option to set the variable name.

# Data Caching (Redis)

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/functions/data-caching-redis

## What is Data Caching?

Xano provides a data caching service, powered by Redis, that allows you to temporarily store data in memory for high-performance data retrieval and storage purposes. This is great for storing temporary data that needs to be quickly generated and accessed for a period of time.

If you are retrieving data from a database or an external API, for example, that you know never, or very infrequently, changes, using data caching can be incredibly valuable.

## **How long can I store data in the Data Cache?**

Through the cache functions you use, you can manually set how long data gets stored, or you can expect it to naturally get overwritten once it reaches the 100MB limit**.**

**Note**

As mentioned above, **Data Caching is temporary storage** - so never store something that can't be recovered - if permanent storage is required, then the database can and should be used.

## Caching Functions

## Set a Cache Value

Redis Cache Values work in key-value pairs. Set a Cache Value function allows you to define a key to reference the cache value in other cache functions. The data input is where you define the data you wish to be cached (the value of the pair). Ttl stands for time to live. Set this, in seconds, to determine how long to cache the data for.

**Key:** define a key name to reference the cache value by.

**Data:** select the value that you wish to cache. This will often be a variable containing data.

**TTL:** define how long, in seconds, for the cache to last. After this time expires, the query will run normally again and reset the data cache value for the specified time. Set this equal to 0 never reset the cache value.

Redis is extremely sensitive to data variation, so you may find it useful to store JSON objects as text strings for easier use of additional caching functions, such as 'removing from list'.

## Get a Cache Value

Get a Cache Value allows you to retrieve a cache value based on the defined key of a set cache value. Get a Cache Value function also outputs a variable so that you can use the data from the cache value in other functions or in the response.

**Key**: enter in the key of a set cache value that you wish to retrieve.

![](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FbnayJiAatBWmLa7GsiOg%252FCleanShot%25202023-01-18%2520at%252010.30.59%25402x.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D6f95bb09-0165-4b52-88a5-f83e6a77ff3b&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=83d7d869&sv=2)

## Has a Cache Value

Has a Cache Value allows you to determine whether or not a cache value exists based on the key. This function will return a boolean of true or false as a variable depending on if the cache value exists.

**Key**: enter a key to find if a cache value exists.

Because the key "user\_info" has a cache value, the return variable is true.

## Delete Cache Value

Delete cache value will delete a cache value based on the key of the cache value.

**Key**: enter in the key of a set cache value in order to delete it.

![](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252F3sApXBMV85eQJAVhfh4t%252FCleanShot%25202023-01-18%2520at%252010.33.22%25402x.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dfe9e3460-a413-47de-b28a-946eb96b6ac0&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c144633b&sv=2)

If we try to Get Cache Value for the same key after it is deleted, the response will come back as false.

![](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252F77VhSIVYnleP3eLR0nXo%252FCleanShot%25202023-01-18%2520at%252010.34.45%25402x.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7b0757b5-286b-478f-a3c9-a6c5041e56ca&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c4d26153&sv=2)

In this example, we are doing a Get Cache Value for the same key that is being deleted in the prior step. We will try to return the return variable of the Get Cache Value.

![](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252F-MgDPmj5FfQTTmYUCws-%252F-MgDSBsQxWUDWIZL2Fxl%252FUntitled%2520presentation%2520%2831%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D002e21c4-6ab4-4226-a1a0-8fd70d531aa3&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c50dc1aa&sv=2)

The Get Cache Value returned a result of false because the cache value was already deleted.

## Increment Cache Value

Increment Cache Value allows you create an Incremental Cache Value by choosing a key and choosing the value to increment by. The incremented value is returned in a variable so you can perform logic based on what the count is.

**Key**: set a key name.

**By**:choose the value to increment by.

![](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FIeHH2hYnwhTa0dXcOfgF%252FCleanShot%25202023-01-18%2520at%252010.45.12%25402x.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dcba3eba3-0067-4899-9627-f3d76eaf2ae4&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=629ede67&sv=2)

Increment Cache Value can act as a lightweight counter. The incremental values are stored on temporary memory, so keep in mind, if the server were to ever restart then the count would be reset.

Use case examples include a promotion where something is available or accessible for the first 100 users. Or perhaps, the 100th user wins the promotion.

## Decrement Cache Value

Decrement Cache Value allows you to decrement a cache value by choosing a key and a value to decrement it by. The decremented cache value is returned in a variable so you can perform additional logic based on its value.

**Key**: create a key name for the decrement cache value.

**By**:choose the value to decrement by.

![](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FYk252ouGMMNb6kLr4xft%252FCleanShot%25202023-01-18%2520at%252010.45.44%25402x.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Defe780fa-dca4-4675-b07b-e45b99e86167&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=2b44f06e&sv=2)

Decrement cache value is similar to increment cache value but it decreases the value. You can also use this as a counter stored on temporary memory.

## Get Cache Keys

Get Cache Keys allows you to retrieve cache keys that match a searched value. You can use "\*" as a wildcard to search. Only putting in "\*" will grab all keys but you can combine it with with text string to narrow your search.

**Search**: enter in they name of the keys you are searching for. Use "\*" as a wildcard.

**Stop**: identifies the end of the elements you would like to retrieve.

You can use negative values to represent the end of the list (ex. -1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on). The start and stop parameters are also inclusive. This means that the results you are given will include the elements at the positions you start and end with.

![](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FLaIQEfn2KP1D4AD0UFIO%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da87cb43a-cdc7-45ad-9ba7-1bdfa180e94b&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=1da3dadd&sv=2)

## Rate Limit

Xano allows you to set rate limits on your queries so that you can limit the requests per given time period that an API endpoint can be called.

The Rate Limit function comes with a few settings for configuration.

**Key**: define a key for the rate limit.

**Max**: set the max amount of requests allowed in the given time or TTL.

**TTL**: set the time to live, in seconds, of each cycle.

**Error**: optionally include an error message. If you include an error message, when the Rate Limit is reached it will automatically throw an error and display this message. If you do not, the Rate Limit will output a boolean of false when the Rate Limit is reached. This can be used if you wish to create custom logic for what happens when the Rate Limit is reached.

# Patch Record

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/functions/database-requests/patch-record

**Patch** is most appropriate when you aren't sure what fields will be updated when editing the record.

## What's the difference between Edit Record and Patch Record?

* **Edit Record** is best used when you have a static expectation for which fields need to be updated when the function is executed. For example, maybe you have an endpoint specifically to allow a user to update their password. Edit Record would make sense here, because you would not be changing any other information.
* **Patch Record** is best used when you have an endpoint that can update multiple fields, but may not always need to do so. Something like a user submitting a collection of edits to their user profile would fall under this example.

**Patch Record** is a little different than **Edit Record** in the way values are provided to it. While Edit Record gives you the option to address each field individually inside of the function, **Patch** only expects a field name and field value (so it knows which record to patch) and a JSON object representing all of the values to be updated.

In the following example, let's say that our record currently looks like this:

Copy

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Chris",
    "email": "chris@email.com",
    "city": "Chicago"
    }
```

We want to build an endpoint that allows our users to update one or more of these fields in one swing. This means that we need to construct a JSON object that contains **only** the values to be updated and provide that to our Patch Record statement.

If Chris wants to update only his city, the object we provide to Patch would look like this:

Copy

```
{
    "city": "Seattle"
    }
```

And our patch statement might look like this:

However, using the **set filter** in the scenario where multiple fields **might** be provided is not recommended. This is because if Patch is provided empty or null values, it will write those to the record, and the goal is to only write the fields we want.

**Please be aware that Patch will write every field provided in the JSON object to the record, even blank and null values.
The JSON object used for Patch should only provide the fields you want to update, and nothing more. Providing empty or null values unintentionally can result in data loss.**

Some frontends will always send empty or null values regardless of what data points are actually defined.

To make Patch work as it is normally expected, you'll want to leverage filters like:

* `filter_null` to remove null values
* `filter_empty_text` to remove empty text strings

Using a **Get All Raw Input** function along with **Patch Record** can be a perfect combination.

* **Get All Raw Input** provides a JSON object of all of the input fields passed to the API.
* We can then provide the output of this function to **Patch Record**, giving us an easy and fast method of building a flexible endpoint for editing records.

Our final endpoint might look something like this:

# Bulk Operations

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/functions/database-requests/bulk-operations

## Bulk Operations

Using bulk operations in Xano is largely the same between operation types. Each function expects an array of data or a custom query that it will use to apply the bulk operation, with the exception of Clear All Records.

The available bulk operations are:

* **Bulk Add Records**
* **Bulk Delete Records**
* **Bulk Patch Records**
* **Bulk Update Records**
* **Clear App Records**

For **Bulk Add Records, Bulk Patch Records, and Bulk Update Records**, you'll need to provide an array of items to add or update in the table.

**Bulk Add** and **Bulk Update** require the entire contents of the record. Make sure to include the record IDs in Bulk Update.

**Bulk Patch** only requires each object to have the ID and the fields you want updated.

For operations like **Bulk Delete**, use the custom query expression to determine which records to delete.

## Using the Expression Builder

Each conditional has four different components.

**Conditional Type**

The conditional type determines how this condition is weighted in the final return. You can choose between **AND** and **OR. AND** conditionals require the present conditional and any others before it to be satisfied, such as "where the date is before today **AND** the user is an admin". **OR** conditionals do not require any other conditionals to be satisfied, such as "if the user is an admin **OR** if the user is a manager".

**Left Value**

This is the first value you're using in the conditional. In a database query, this is usually going to be a column that you want to check against.

**Operators**

Please note that operators may differ based on where you are building the expression. Database queries will have different operators available than regular conditional statements. Learn More

* **Equals (==)** - an exact match
* **Not Equals (!=)** - does not equal
* **Equals with type matching (===)** - an exact value match and an exact type match

  + Ex. Variable **var\_1** has a value of 123, with a type of text. You set up a conditional statement to check if **var\_1 === 123**, but your value in the conditional statement is of type integer. This would return false, because the types do not match.
* **Not equals with type matching (!==)** - does not equal value or type, similar to ===
* **Greater than (>)** - the value on the left is greater than the value on the right
* **Greater than or equals (≥)** - the value on the left is greater than or equals to the value on the right.
* **Less than (<)** - the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
* **Less than or equals (≤)** - the value on the left is less than or equals to the value on the right.
* **LIKE** - Used for comparing text. Like is case-insensitive and compares if a text string is like another text string. It can be thought of as equals for text but upper case and lower case does not matter.
* **NOT LIKE** - Used for comparing text. Not Like is case-insensitive and compares if a text string is not like another. It is like not equals for text but upper case and lower case does not matter.
* **INCLUDES** - Used for comparing text. Includes is a flexible operator and is case-insensitive. It is able to determine if there is a partial match in a text string.
* **DOES NOT INCLUDE** - Used for comparing text. Does not include determines if a text string is not included in another text string.
* **IN** - If a single value is found in an array (list). Start with the single value on the left side and the right side should contain the array.
* **NOT IN** - If a single value is not found in an array (list). The single value should be on the left side and the array on the right side.

* **OVERLAPS** - Used for comparing two arrays. Overlaps determines if any values in one array are present in the second array.
* **DOES NOT OVERLAP** - Used for comparing two arrays. Does not overlaps determines if no values in the first array are present in the second array.
* **CONTAINS** - Contains is an advanced filter used for JSON and arrays. It looks for an exact schema match.
* **DOES NOT CONTAIN** - Does not contain is the opposite of contains. It determines if there is not an exact schema match.

## Right Value

The right value is whatever you are checking against the left value. This could be a hardcoded value, a variable, or even a database field from the same record.

## Clear All Records

Clear All Records will delete every record in the table.

# Array

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/data-types/array

An array is just another name for a list of items. These items can be anything from text, to integers, to full objects and complex data structures.

An array is always contained inside of square brackets: **[ ]**

Copy

```
[
    1,
    2,
    3
]
```

Copy

```
[
    "Hello",

# Object

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/data-types/object

Think of a JSON object like a labeled container system - similar to how you might organize items in your kitchen. Just as you store different ingredients in containers with clear labels, a JSON object stores information with descriptive labels. The descriptive label is known as a **key**, and the value itself is referred to as **value**.

Objects can also contain separate complex data types in each key, such as arrays.

Copy

```
{
    "recipeName": "Chocolate Chip Cookies",
    "cookingTime": 12,
    "ingredients": [
                        "flour",
                        "sugar",
                        "chocolate chips"],
    "isGlutenFree": false

# Boolean

Source: https://docs.xano.com/the-function-stack/data-types/boolean

A boolean is a true or false value. While "true" and "false" are just text, it is important to use a boolean instead of a text field due to differing behavior between the data types.

Copy

```
true

Copy

```
false

```
{
    "dogName": "Max",
    "catName": null,
    "fishName": ""

# Change Server Region

Source: https://docs.xano.com/xano-features/instance-settings/change-server-region

Xano's paid plans allows you to choose your server region. At the time of this page was published, server regions include:

1. Australia (Sydney)
2. Belgium
3. Brazil (São Paulo)
4. Canada (Montreal)
5. France (Paris)
6. Germany (Frankfurt)
7. India (Mumbai)
8. Indonesia (Jakarta)
9. Japan (Tokyo)
10. Saudi Arabia (Dammam)
11. Singapore
12. South Korea (Seoul)
13. United Kingdom (London)
14. United States (Oregon)

From the billing section, you are able to select where you would like your server to be located.

## Before You Proceed

1

## Changing server regions will change your API base URL

Your instance has a specific URL, such as https://abc1-def2-ghi3.xano.io/ and all of your API endpoints begin with this.

When you change regions, because you are migrating to a new server, your base URL will change.

After selecting your new server region, you will be given an option to beging the migration, so you have time to update anything necessary before proceeding.

**Be sure to update any external connections with the new URL prior to initiating the migration.**

2

## Unpublished drafts will NOT be migrated

Make sure to publish anything you want to save before proceeding.

## How to Change Server Region

1

2

3

## Select your existing plan to ensure no billing changes are made. You can also choose to upgrade your plan at this time, if you'd like.

Changing server regions is **free**, but because your subscription restarts when making this change, you will be billed at checkout for the cost of your plan, minus any unused time on your current subscription period.

4

## Scroll down to Server Region and select where you'd like your server to be hosted.

Use the dropdown to select your region of choice.

5

## Proceed through checkout.

6

## After checkout, review your new server URL and update any external connections.

7

## Once you're ready, proceed with the migration by clicking the button shown below.

# Compliance Center

Source: https://docs.xano.com/enterprise/enterprise-features/compliance-center

The Compliance Center is included with **Scale** and **Enterprise** plans. Certain plans may not contain all of the available features of the Compliance Center.

## What is the Compliance Center?

The **Compliance Center** provides a comprehensive history of changes made to your workspace objects. This feature allows you to track modifications, understand who made them, when they occurred, and on which Branch.

This detailed tracking offers valuable insights for collaboration, auditing, and understanding the evolution of your project. The Compliance Center records changes to the following workspace elements:

* Database tables and schema
* API groups
* API endpoints
* Addons
* Custom functions
* Background tasks

**Important Note:** Changes to individual records within your database are not tracked by the Compliance Center.

By providing a clear and accessible log of workspace modifications, the Compliance Center enhances team transparency and simplifies the process of understanding project history. This can be particularly useful for:

* **Collaboration:** Easily identify when and by whom specific changes were implemented.
* **Auditing:** Maintain a record of modifications for internal reviews or compliance requirements.
* **Troubleshooting:** Understand recent changes that may have impacted functionality.
* **Onboarding:** Quickly bring new team members up to speed on the project's development.

The Compliance Center is a valuable tool for maintaining a well-documented and understandable development process within your Xano workspaces.

## Using the Compliance Center

To access the Compliance Center navigate to the Settings tab of the workspace, open the menu icon in the top right, and select Compliance.

Inside the Compliance Center, you can access various reporting areas for different types of activity in your workspace.

Each change to a workspace object is recorded in the Compliance Center:

* **ID** - the unique ID of a specific change.
* **Object** - the Workspace Object that was changed.
* **Branch** - which Branch the change occurred on.
* **Author** - the team member that made that change.
* **Date** - the time the change occurred.

## Activity Logs

Activity Logs provide an aggregated dashboard of all admin related activity across the workspace.

## Middleware Reporting

## Version History

Version History is an aggregated dashboard of all schema changes across tables, APIs, functions, addons, and tasks.

You can click on any one of these items and immediately navigate to the item that was changed to review further as necessary.

## Trigger Reporting

Similar to Middleware Reporting, Trigger Reporting allows you to audit and verify triggers. You can review both database triggers and workspace triggers.

## Instance Activity

The Compliance Center add-on also includes Instance Activity, available from your instance selection screen.
Instance Activity offers administrators history on access to the instance. This includes login events and instance access activity, as well as team member management and permission updates. This includes time and date, user name, their location, IP address, and user agent.

Instance Activity will report on **login**, **instance connect**, **instance update**, **RBAC update**, **Team update**, **Agency update**, **Image Upload**, **Custom Domain Change**, and **License Requests**.

# Deployment

Source: https://docs.xano.com/enterprise/enterprise-features/deployment

## Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

If your organization already operates with a tested and approved Cloud Provider, Xano can be deployed on other providers such as AWS, Azure, or another Google Cloud instance. Each Xano Instance will be hosted within your own cloud account. This provides complete control and access to all of your data and infrastructure. BYOC includes Data Sovereignty, Regional Support, Scaling Configurations, direct access to all resources through RBAC, and the ability to host unlimited Xano instances\* within the GCP account. (*\*Separate licenses are required for each Xano instance*).

## On-Premise

On-premise cloud computing means that an organization uses its own physical infrastructure to deploy cloud resources, ensuring high levels of security. Each Xano Instance will be hosted within your on-premise environment. This option is reserved for organizations that require the utmost security standards.

## Highly Available Edition (Multi-zone Configuration)

Highly Available Edition is recommended for critical production applications or any application needing to minimize downtime and increase reliability. Xano configures multiple zones to ensure continuous operations without failing for a designated period of time. Multi-Zone Configuration helps provide redundancy with data backups across zones, failover capabilities, and automatic recovery. These play an essential role in ensuring organizations meet their availability goals and SLAs. In the event of an outage in one zone, another zone is automatically able to take over helping prevent data loss and maximizing application resiliency.

# Troubleshooting Performance

Source: https://docs.xano.com/troubleshooting-and-support/troubleshooting-performance

## Debugging Performance Issues

502 errors when calling APIs or otherwise experiencing slow performance typically means that you are maxing out your instance resources. This means you should consider ways to increase performance. It is almost impossible to make a strict determination on “what package do I need” because everyone’s logic and data volume is different.

There are several variables to look at when addressing performance issues, including:

* The volume of API requests and the time between them
* The complexity of the business logic
* The amount of data being sent/received.

If your instance hits maximum resource usage, reported statistics may no longer be accurate.

# Function Stack Performance

Source: https://docs.xano.com/troubleshooting-and-support/troubleshooting-performance/function-stack-performance

Xano does a lot of work behind the scenes to ensure your API response time is as fast as possible. That said, there are best practices that should be followed when you're building your API endpoints to avoid slowing down your server.

## What is "good" performance?

The performance of your API endpoint depends on a number of different variables which include:

* The complexity of your function stack and the number of statements that execute
* How much data is being processed
* How your Database is set up/indexed (if you're querying the Database)
* Server location and resources

**Examples below are using a Xano paid plan (Dedicated resources) with a local server:**

The below response times will change depending on your Xano plan and load on your Xano Instance.

Task

Statements

Median Response

Get 100 Records

1

**< 1 second**

Filter 100,000 records by one field

1

**< 1 second**

Bulk Add 10k records

1

**< 1 second**

Transform 100k records (Change field to uppercase)

3

**< 1 second**

Bulk Delete (Recursive)

502

**< 5 seconds**

*\*< 1 second = under 1 second*

*\*\*The results are the median response times between Launch, Scale, and Scale-2x.*

## How to improve your API response times

2. **Optimize Database Performance**There are many ways to set up the Database for your application. Unfortunately, there are inefficient ways to set this up that can slow your app down. You'll have to go through a few iterations to find the most efficient way for your use case.
3. **Simplify your Function Stack**This may seem obvious, but producing a response in ten (10) functions is slower than doing it in three (3). It's also important to remember that the number of functions in the function stack could be different than the statements that get executed (for example, if you have a loop).

# Community Code of Conduct

Source: https://docs.xano.com/troubleshooting-and-support/getting-help/community-code-of-conduct

## Our Pledge

In order to create a welcoming and inclusive community, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Participating in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempting collaboration before conflict.
* Refraining from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Being mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Promotional messages are not acceptable unless authorized by the Moderator.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in-person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## Culture Citizenship

One of the many goals of this Code of Conduct is to strengthen our community, uplift and encourage each other, and to recognize the positive effects of our community on the industry as a whole.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

Communities often mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power.

As a community, we choose to focus on the impact of our individual actions rather than our intent. We recognize that when it comes to people's lives and identities, the impact of our actions can be profound and wide-reaching.

While, individually, we can never fully understand the ways in which oppressive acts or language impact those around us, we can listen with every desire to understand, and can work to change our behavior.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The moderator is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Privacy

While Xano Builders is an open and welcoming community, citation of other's comments in a public forum must have the prior permission of the contributor(s).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Moderator responsible for enforcement at [buildroom@xano.com](mailto:hello@virtualcoffee.io) . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The Moderator is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The Moderator will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

## 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from the moderator, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

## 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with the Moderator, for a period of time specified by the moderator. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

## 3. Conditional Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a period of time specified by the Moderator. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with the moderator, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

## 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## If you've done something improper

Engaging in diverse communities, we may accidentally cause offense by using unknowingly offensive terminology or by missing social cues. Recognizing the impact of your actions is far more important than your intent.

If you realize (or are told) that you have offended someone, then please consider taking the appropriate steps:

1. Acknowledge that you've done something inappropriate.
2. Briefly apologize. Do not minimize the issue. If you believe it helps to explain your intent, first listen, and hear out the other person. Then, speak with respect.
3. If possible, edit your message, restate your communication in a better way, or withdraw your statement. Publicly revising your statement helps define the culture for others.

This will allow the conversation to quickly continue without any need for further action or escalation of the situation.

If you don't understand what you did wrong, assume that the hurt party has good cause and accept it. We cannot know everyone's background and should do our best to avoid harm. After all, in the end, what does the intent of our action really matter if our actions have the impact of furthering the marginalization or oppression of those around us.

**Note:** Posts that don't adhere to the Code of Conduct may be removed at the discretion of our moderators.
