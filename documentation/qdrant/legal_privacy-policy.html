Data processing outside the EEA</strong></h3><p>Insofar as we transfer data to service providers or other third parties outside the EEA, the security of the data during the transfer is guaranteed by adequacy decisions of the EU Commission, insofar as they exist (e.g. for Great Britain, Canada and Israel) (Art. 45 para. 3 GDPR).</p><p>In the case of data transfer to service providers in the USA, the legal basis for the data transfer is an adequacy decision of the EU Commission if the service provider has also certified itself under the EU US Data Privacy Framework.</p><p>In other cases (e.g. if no adequacy decision exists), the legal basis for the data transfer are usually, i.e. unless we indicate otherwise, standard contractual clauses. These are a set of rules adopted by the EU Commission and are part of the contract with the respective third party. According to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. b GDPR, they ensure the security of the data transfer. Many of the providers have given contractual guarantees that go beyond the standard contractual clauses to protect the data. These include, for example, guarantees regarding the encryption of data or regarding an obligation on the part of the third party to notify data subjects if law enforcement agencies wish to access the respective data.</p><h3 id=14-storage-duration><strong>1.4. Storage duration</strong></h3><p>Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and no legal obligations to retain data conflict with the deletion. If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing is restricted, i.e. the data are blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons.</p><h3 id=15-rights-of-data-subjects><strong>1.5. Rights of data subjects</strong></h3><p>Data subjects have the following rights against us with regard to their personal data:</p><ul><li>Right of access,</li><li>Right to correction or deletion,</li><li>Right to limit processing,</li><li>Right to object to the processing,</li><li>Right to data transferability,</li><li>Right to revoke a given consent at any time.</li></ul><p>Data subjects also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of their personal data.

Without this data, we will generally have to refuse to conclude the contract or to provide a service or will no longer be able to perform an existing contract or other relationship.</p><p>Mandatory data are marked as such.</p><h3 id=17-no-automatic-decision-making-in-individual-cases><strong>1.7. No automatic decision making in individual cases</strong></h3><p>As a matter of principle, we do not use a fully automated decision-making process in accordance with article 22 GDPR to establish and implement the business or other relationship.

We delete the data accruing in this context after the storage is no longer necessary or restrict the processing if there are legal retention obligations.</p><h3 id=19-customer-surveys><strong>1.9. Customer surveys</strong></h3><p>From time to time, we conduct customer surveys to get to know our customers and their wishes better. In doing so, we collect the data requested in each case. It is our legitimate interest to get to know our customers and their wishes better, so that the legal basis for the associated data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit f GDPR. We delete the data accruing in this context after the storage is no longer necessary, or restrict the processing if there are legal retention obligations.</p><h3 id=110-educational-resources><strong>1.10.

The processing is based on consent. Data subjects may revoke their consent at any time by contacting us, for example, using the contact details provided in our privacy policy. The revocation does not affect the lawfulness of the processing until the revocation.</p><h2 id=2-newsletter><strong>2.

We process the data provided during registration exclusively for sending the newsletter.

By means of this so-called single sign-on procedure, we want to make it easier for you to register and log in to the Qdrant Cloud Service. Because in this way you do not have to remember any further access and login data for your use of the Qdrant Cloud Service. If you use a single sign-on procedure, we receive the information from the relevant provider that you have released for transmission. The legal basis for processing by us is your express consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter a) of the GDPR. This information may be, in particular, your name, your e-mail address, the user ID with the provider concerned and, if applicable, a profile picture.</p><p>We would like to point out that, in accordance with the data protection conditions and terms of use of the providers, there may also be a transfer of further data when consent is given if this has been marked as ‚Äúpublic‚Äù in your privacy settings or otherwise approved by you for transfer for the purposes of the single sign-on procedure. However, of the data transmitted to us, we only process the data that is necessary for registration and login to the Qdrant Cloud Service (Art. 6 para. 1 letter b) of the GDPR); we delete any further data transmitted to us immediately upon receipt.</p><p>For the purpose and scope of data transmission in the context of the use of single sign-on procedures and the further processing and use of your data by the providers, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy, please refer to the data protection notices of the providers concerned:</p><ul><li>Google: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <a href=https://policies.google.com/privacy target=_blank rel="noopener nofollow">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li><li>Github: Github B.V., Prins Bernhardplein 200, Amsterdam, 1097JB, The Netherlands: <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement target=_blank rel="noopener nofollow">https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement</a></li></ul><p>To further secure the registration process and to offer the single sign-on procedure, we also use the ‚ÄúAuth0‚Äù service of the provider Auth0, Inc., 10800 NE 8th Street, Suite 600, Bellevue, WA 98004, U.S.A (‚ÄúAuth0‚Äù).

Data processing on social media platforms</strong></h2><p>We are represented in social media networks in order to present our organization and our services there. The operators of these networks regularly process their users&rsquo; data for advertising purposes. Among other things, they create user profiles from their online behavior, which are used, for example, to show advertising on the pages of the networks and elsewhere on the Internet that corresponds to the interests of the users. To this end, the operators of the networks store information on user behavior in cookies on the users&rsquo; computers. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the operators merge this information with other data. Users can obtain further information and instructions on how to object to processing by the site operators in the data protection declarations of the respective operators listed below. It is also possible that the operators or their servers are located in non-EU countries, so that they process data there. This may result in risks for users, e.g. because it is more difficult to enforce their rights or because government agencies access the data.</p><p>If users of the networks contact us via our profiles, we process the data provided to us in order to respond to the inquiries.
