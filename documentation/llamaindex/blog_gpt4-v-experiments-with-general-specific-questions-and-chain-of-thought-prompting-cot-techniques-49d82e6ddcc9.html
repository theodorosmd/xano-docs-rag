proficiency in interpreting bar charts, scatter plots, and tables. We aim to assess whether specific questioning and chain of thought prompting can yield better responses compared to broader inquiries. Our demonstration seeks to determine if GPT-4V can exceed these known limitations with precise questioning and systematic reasoning techniques.</p><p>We observed in these experiments that asking specific questions, rather than general ones, yields better answers. Let’s delve into these experiments.</p><p>You can also follow along with this blog post in our <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/multi_modal/gpt4v_experiments_cot.ipynb" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Colab Notebook</a>.</p><blockquote><p id="2203" class="oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj">N<!-- -->OTE: This blog post aims to inform the community about GPT-4V’s performance, though the results might not be universally applicable.

Each of these categories has a number in parentheses, indicating the sample size of reported incidents for each type of violation (395, 728, and 311, respectively). The x-axis of the chart specifies various social media platforms or services, such as “Video sharing”, “Social networking”, “Gaming”, “Dating”, “Forums &amp; boards”, “Commercial Websites”, “Media sharing”, “P2P/File sharing”, “Wiki”, and “Other”. It appears to measure how often these categories of violations occur on each type of platform. The y-axis measures the percentage of violations reported, ranging from 0% to 60%. Each platform/service has three bars corresponding to the three violation categories, showing their respective percentages. The bars also have error bars, which typically represent the variability of the data, such as standard deviation, standard error, or confidence interval, indicating the precision of the estimates. The chart has a legend indicating the color corresponding to each of the three categories of violations. This visual representation helps to compare the prevalence of different types of violations across the different types of online services. Without specific numbers, it’s not possible to provide exact percentages, but we can observe trends, such as: — “Forums &amp; boards” and “Social networking” platforms have notably higher percentages across all three types of violations compared to other platforms. — “Commercial Websites” seem to have lower percentages of reported hateful and harmful activities and unqualified advice but higher percentages of illicit and criminal activities when compared to other platforms like “Wiki” or “P2P/File sharing”. — “Gaming” appears to have a moderate percentage of hateful and harmful violations, lower levels of illicit and criminal activity, and relatively higher levels of unqualified advice. Overall, this chart is a visual tool that likely aims to inform about the prevalence of certain types of online violations across different digital platforms.</p></blockquote><h2>Observation:</h2><p>As you can see though the categories hateful and harmful, illicit and criminal activity, and unqualified advice but it hallucinated with x-axis values with — “Video sharing”, “Social networking”, “Gaming”, “Dating”, “Forums &amp; boards”, “Commercial Websites”, “Media sharing”, “P2P/File sharing”, “Wiki”, and “Other”.</p><h1>Specific Questions:</h1><p><strong>Question: </strong>Which model among llama2 and vicuna models does better in terms of violation percentages in Hateful and harmful category.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><blockquote><p id="a020" class="oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj">From the provided bar chart, we can analyze the violation percentage for both the Llama2 and Vicuna models in the “Hateful and harmful” category. To determine which model does better (i.e., has a lower violation percentage), you would look at the height of the bars corresponding to each model within that category. In the “Hateful and harmful” category (which is the first group of bars on the left), you can compare the blue bar (representing Llama2) to the light blue bar (representing Vicuna). The model with the shorter bar in this category will have a lower violation percentage, and hence, better performance with respect to minimizing hateful and harmful content. Please note that I cannot physically see the chart, so I’m unable to specify which model has the lower violation percentage.

Based on the visual information given, I can compare the two models within this category by observing the heights of the light blue bars (Llama2) versus the heights of the dark blue bars (Vicuna) for each subsection within the category. A lower bar indicates a lower violation rate, which could be interpreted as better performance in minimizing violations for the given criteria. Since I can’t give you the exact numbers or percentages, I would describe their relative performances. It appears that for some subsections, the Llama2 bars are shorter than the Vicuna bars, suggesting that the Llama2 model could have a lower violation rate in those areas. Conversely, in other subsections, the Vicuna bars might be shorter than the Llama2 bars, indicating a lower violation rate for the Vicuna model in those areas. The exact subsections where one model outperforms the other would depend on their relative bar heights, which should be compared individually for the given information.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Observation:</strong></h2><p>It did answer the question correctly.</p><h1>Chain Of Thought Prompting:</h1><p><strong>Question: </strong>Based on the image provided.

The models compared are LLaMA 2, LLaMA 13B, Mistral, and GPT-3. Each graph plots the performance metric (on the y-axis) against the model size measured in billions of effective parameters (on the x-axis). In general, these plots demonstrate that as the model size increases, the performance on each metric improves. Here are specific observations for each graph: 1. Natural Language Understanding (Top left): All models show an increase in NLU performance as the model size increases. Mistral is depicted as the highest-performing model at each size benchmark. 2. Reasoning (Top right): Again, larger models perform better on reasoning tasks, with Mistral consistently outperforming the other models mentioned. 3. Knowledge (Bottom left): Similar to the NLU and reasoning tasks, the trend is for better performance with larger models, with Mistral leading across the different sizes. 4. Commonsense (Bottom right): This graph follows the same trend with the Mistral model performing better at each size level compared to the other models. Based on these graphs, Mistral appears to be the top-performing model in all four metrics, suggesting that it might be more efficient or effective than LLaMA 2, LLaMA 13B, and GPT-3, at least within the scope of the parameters and tasks represented here. On a technical note, it’s important to mention that the y-axis shows different scales for the metrics (ranging from 45–75% for NLU, Knowledge, and Commonsense, and from 50–72% for Reasoning), which suggests that these tasks might have different levels of difficulty or different benchmarks for success.</p></blockquote><h2>Observation:</h2><p>It did answer the query but hallucinated with the NLU task which is the MMLU task and assumed Mistral is available across all different model parameters.</p><h1>Specific Questions:</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> How well does mistral model compared to llama2 model?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><blockquote><p id="2674" class="oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj">The image you’ve provided contains four graphs, each plotting different performance metrics for evaluating language models. It compares two models: Mistral and LLaMA2 across four different aspects — MMLU (Multi-tasking multiple-choice), Reasoning, Knowledge, and Commonsense. In each graph, the performance metric is plotted on the y-axis while the effective model size in billion parameters is plotted on the x-axis. Here’s a summary based on the trends observed in the graphs: 1. **MMLU (Top Left Graph)**: LLaMA2 shows a steeper performance curve as the model size increases, starting at around 61% for the smallest size and reaching upwards of 66% for the largest model. Mistral also shows performance gains with model size but plateaus earlier, reaching a level just shy of 62%. 2. **Reasoning (Top Right Graph)**: In the reasoning task, LLaMA2 again has a steeper improvement curve, starting from about 61% and surpassing 72% for the largest model. Mistral, while improving, seems to plateau near 70% for the largest model. 3. **Knowledge (Bottom Left Graph)**: This graph reflects a similar trend to the previous ones, with LLaMA2 beginning at a lower performance around 46% and eclipsing 52%. Mistral starts higher at around 48% and appears to plateau near 52%. 4. **Commonsense (Bottom Right Graph)**: Here, LLaMA2 starts its performance at approximately 62% and reaches just above 66%. Mistral seems to start at a slightly higher point than LLaMA2 but ends at a similar level to LLaMA2’s largest model. Overall, the LLaMA2 model appears to show a greater degree of improvement in performance as the model size increases compared to Mistral across these metrics. Meanwhile, Mistral starts at a higher performance for some metrics but tends to plateau earlier, suggesting that LLaMA2 may scale better with size in terms of performance gains.</p></blockquote><h2>Observation:</h2><p>Incorrect answers and percentages are not accurate enough and again assumed mistral is available across all parameter models.</p><p><strong>Question: </strong>Assuming mistral is available in 7B series. How well does mistral model compared to llama2 model?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><blockquote><p id="7660" class="oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj">This image appears to be a set of four graphs, each comparing the performance of three different language models on various tasks: Mistral, LLaMA-2, and a hypothetical “Size 7B” model. The graphs are labeled with task-specific performance metrics: “MLM U”, “Reasoning”, “Knowledge”, and “Commonsense”. The x-axes on the graphs represent model size in terms of the number of parameters, with three points that likely correspond to the sizes of the models being compared. The y-axes represent performance as a percentage, which could mean accuracy, precision, recall, or another relevant performance metric depending on the specific task. The graphs appear to show that Mistral performs better than LLaMA-2 and the Size 7B model across all metrics. This indicates that within the context of these measurements and tasks, Mistral is a stronger model. The exact nature of the tasks or what “MLM U”, “Reasoning”, “Knowledge”, and “Commonsense” specifically refer to are not detailed in the image, but they likely correspond to standard NLP tasks designed to test understanding of language, ability to reason, knowledge recall, and commonsense reasoning, respectively. The performance improvements are depicted as increasingly significant with larger model sizes.</p></blockquote><h2>Observation:</h2><p>Now by giving the detail that mistral is available in 7B series, it is able to answer correctly.</p><h1>Chain of thought prompting:</h1><p><strong>Question: </strong>Based on the image provided.

Each graph shows performance as a function of model size (in terms of billion parameters). Identify Relevant Data: We need to focus on the Mistral and Llama 2 models across all four graphs to extract the relevant data. For mAP@L: — Llama 2 reaches above 65% when reaching 70 billion parameters. — Mistral starts at around 5 billion parameters with about 48% and reaches almost 65% by the time it gets to 34 billion parameters. For Reason@L: — Llama 2 reaches about 68% when reaching 70 billion parameters. — Mistral starts at around 5 billion parameters with about 52% and reaches almost 68% by the time it gets to 34 billion parameters. For Knowledge@L: — Llama 2 starts at about 45% with 1.3 billion parameters and reaches just slightly under 60% by 70 billion parameters. — Mistral is not plotted in this graph, so no direct comparison can be made. For Comprehension@L: — Llama 2 starts just above 40% with 1.3 billion parameters and reaches just under 60% by 70 billion parameters. — Mistral starts around 13 billion parameters with about 52% and continues above 62% by 34 billion parameters. Evaluate: From the graphs, we can see that Mistral and Llama 2 are very comparable in performance in the metrics where both are shown. However, Mistral is not displayed on the Knowledge@L graph, so no comparison can be made for that particular metric. Draw a Conclusion: In the graphs where both models can be compared (mAP@L, Reason@L, and Comprehension@L), Mistral appears to perform comparably to Llama 2, reaching similar levels of performance at smaller parameter sizes relative to the plotted sizes for Llama 2. This suggests that Mistral could be more parameter-efficient. However, since there is no data for Mistral in the Knowledge@L graph, we cannot draw a complete comparison</p></blockquote><h2>Observation:</h2><p>There is a hallucination with a number of model parameters and percentage points though the final conclusion is partially correct.</p><h1>Image 3 — Performances of different LLMs across various NLP tasks.</h1><figure><img src="/blog/images/1*EdZACHs8CZEtduO1Y7e3Qw.png" alt="" width="700" height="239"></figure><h1>General Question:</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> Analyze the Image.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><blockquote><p id="0b3d" class="oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj">The image appears to be a table containing numerical data, which seems to be a comparative analysis of various models across multiple parameters or tests. Each row represents a different model or configuration as indicated by names such as “MPT” and “Falcon” followed by a size specification like “70B,” “7B,” or some other parameter. The columns are labeled with test names or evaluation metrics, such as “Size,” “Avg,” “AQuA-RAT,” “LogiQA,” “L-SAT-AR,” “L-SAT-IC,” “L-SAT-RC,” “SAT-en (w/o Psg.),” and “SAT-math.” The data is likely related to performance scores of these models on these tests, where higher numbers probably indicate better performance. Without additional context, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis of this data, but it seems clear that it is intended to provide a performance comparison between different models on various tasks, possibly in the field of machine learning or artificial intelligence evaluations, where such models are typically assessed on reasoning, comprehension, or problem-solving capabilities. The “70B” and “7B” demarcations could refer to the size of the model in terms of the number of parameters, commonly used in assessing language models. A deeper evaluation would require further insights into the specific nature of these tests and models, along with the intended use-case for which they were being compared.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Observation:</strong></h2><p>It did not analyze the image specifically but understood the overall data present in the image to some extent.</p><h1>Specific Questions:</h1><p><strong>Question: </strong>which model has higher performance in SAT-en?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><blockquote><p id="0084" class="oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj">In the table you’ve provided, the models are compared based on their performance on several benchmarks, including SAT-en (SAT Analogies, or “SAT” in the table).

Each of these categories has a number in parentheses, indicating the sample size of reported incidents for each type of violation (395, 728, and 311, respectively). The x-axis of the chart specifies various social media platforms or services, such as “Video sharing”, “Social networking”, “Gaming”, “Dating”, “Forums \u0026amp; boards”, “Commercial Websites”, “Media sharing”, “P2P/File sharing”, “Wiki”, and “Other”. It appears to measure how often these categories of violations occur on each type of platform. The y-axis measures the percentage of violations reported, ranging from 0% to 60%. Each platform/service has three bars corresponding to the three violation categories, showing their respective percentages. The bars also have error bars, which typically represent the variability of the data, such as standard deviation, standard error, or confidence interval, indicating the precision of the estimates. The chart has a legend indicating the color corresponding to each of the three categories of violations. This visual representation helps to compare the prevalence of different types of violations across the different types of online services. Without specific numbers, it’s not possible to provide exact percentages, but we can observe trends, such as: — “Forums \u0026amp; boards” and “Social networking” platforms have notably higher percentages across all three types of violations compared to other platforms. — “Commercial Websites” seem to have lower percentages of reported hateful and harmful activities and unqualified advice but higher percentages of illicit and criminal activities when compared to other platforms like “Wiki” or “P2P/File sharing”. — “Gaming” appears to have a moderate percentage of hateful and harmful violations, lower levels of illicit and criminal activity, and relatively higher levels of unqualified advice. Overall, this chart is a visual tool that likely aims to inform about the prevalence of certain types of online violations across different digital platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch2\u003eObservation:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see though the categories hateful and harmful, illicit and criminal activity, and unqualified advice but it hallucinated with x-axis values with — “Video sharing”, “Social networking”, “Gaming”, “Dating”, “Forums \u0026amp; boards”, “Commercial Websites”, “Media sharing”, “P2P/File sharing”, “Wiki”, and “Other”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1\u003eSpecific Questions:\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion: \u003c/strong\u003eWhich model among llama2 and vicuna models does better in terms of violation percentages in Hateful and harmful category.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnswer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"a020\" class=\"oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj\"\u003eFrom the provided bar chart, we can analyze the violation percentage for both the Llama2 and Vicuna models in the “Hateful and harmful” category. To determine which model does better (i.e., has a lower violation percentage), you would look at the height of the bars corresponding to each model within that category. In the “Hateful and harmful” category (which is the first group of bars on the left), you can compare the blue bar (representing Llama2) to the light blue bar (representing Vicuna). The model with the shorter bar in this category will have a lower violation percentage, and hence, better performance with respect to minimizing hateful and harmful content. Please note that I cannot physically see the chart, so I’m unable to specify which model has the lower violation percentage. If you provide the actual percentages or describe the relative bar lengths for Llama2 and Vicuna in the “Hateful and harmful” category, I could then tell you which model performs better in that respect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eObservation:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt failed to accurately capture the information, mistakenly identifying the light blue bar as representing Vicuna when, in fact, it is the light blue bar that represents Llama2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet us give more information on the question and see if it can improve the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion: \u003c/strong\u003eIn the image provided to you depicts about the violation rate performance of various AI models across Hateful and harmful, Illicit and criminal activity, Unqualified advice categories.

Based on the visual information given, I can compare the two models within this category by observing the heights of the light blue bars (Llama2) versus the heights of the dark blue bars (Vicuna) for each subsection within the category. A lower bar indicates a lower violation rate, which could be interpreted as better performance in minimizing violations for the given criteria. Since I can’t give you the exact numbers or percentages, I would describe their relative performances. It appears that for some subsections, the Llama2 bars are shorter than the Vicuna bars, suggesting that the Llama2 model could have a lower violation rate in those areas. Conversely, in other subsections, the Vicuna bars might be shorter than the Llama2 bars, indicating a lower violation rate for the Vicuna model in those areas.

The models compared are LLaMA 2, LLaMA 13B, Mistral, and GPT-3. Each graph plots the performance metric (on the y-axis) against the model size measured in billions of effective parameters (on the x-axis). In general, these plots demonstrate that as the model size increases, the performance on each metric improves. Here are specific observations for each graph: 1. Natural Language Understanding (Top left): All models show an increase in NLU performance as the model size increases. Mistral is depicted as the highest-performing model at each size benchmark. 2. Reasoning (Top right): Again, larger models perform better on reasoning tasks, with Mistral consistently outperforming the other models mentioned. 3. Knowledge (Bottom left): Similar to the NLU and reasoning tasks, the trend is for better performance with larger models, with Mistral leading across the different sizes. 4. Commonsense (Bottom right): This graph follows the same trend with the Mistral model performing better at each size level compared to the other models. Based on these graphs, Mistral appears to be the top-performing model in all four metrics, suggesting that it might be more efficient or effective than LLaMA 2, LLaMA 13B, and GPT-3, at least within the scope of the parameters and tasks represented here. On a technical note, it’s important to mention that the y-axis shows different scales for the metrics (ranging from 45–75% for NLU, Knowledge, and Commonsense, and from 50–72% for Reasoning), which suggests that these tasks might have different levels of difficulty or different benchmarks for success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch2\u003eObservation:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt did answer the query but hallucinated with the NLU task which is the MMLU task and assumed Mistral is available across all different model parameters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1\u003eSpecific Questions:\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion:\u003c/strong\u003e How well does mistral model compared to llama2 model?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnswer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"2674\" class=\"oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj\"\u003eThe image you’ve provided contains four graphs, each plotting different performance metrics for evaluating language models. It compares two models: Mistral and LLaMA2 across four different aspects — MMLU (Multi-tasking multiple-choice), Reasoning, Knowledge, and Commonsense. In each graph, the performance metric is plotted on the y-axis while the effective model size in billion parameters is plotted on the x-axis. Here’s a summary based on the trends observed in the graphs: 1. **MMLU (Top Left Graph)**: LLaMA2 shows a steeper performance curve as the model size increases, starting at around 61% for the smallest size and reaching upwards of 66% for the largest model. Mistral also shows performance gains with model size but plateaus earlier, reaching a level just shy of 62%. 2. **Reasoning (Top Right Graph)**: In the reasoning task, LLaMA2 again has a steeper improvement curve, starting from about 61% and surpassing 72% for the largest model. Mistral, while improving, seems to plateau near 70% for the largest model. 3. **Knowledge (Bottom Left Graph)**: This graph reflects a similar trend to the previous ones, with LLaMA2 beginning at a lower performance around 46% and eclipsing 52%. Mistral starts higher at around 48% and appears to plateau near 52%. 4. **Commonsense (Bottom Right Graph)**: Here, LLaMA2 starts its performance at approximately 62% and reaches just above 66%. Mistral seems to start at a slightly higher point than LLaMA2 but ends at a similar level to LLaMA2’s largest model. Overall, the LLaMA2 model appears to show a greater degree of improvement in performance as the model size increases compared to Mistral across these metrics. Meanwhile, Mistral starts at a higher performance for some metrics but tends to plateau earlier, suggesting that LLaMA2 may scale better with size in terms of performance gains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch2\u003eObservation:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncorrect answers and percentages are not accurate enough and again assumed mistral is available across all parameter models.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion: \u003c/strong\u003eAssuming mistral is available in 7B series.

The graphs are labeled with task-specific performance metrics: “MLM U”, “Reasoning”, “Knowledge”, and “Commonsense”. The x-axes on the graphs represent model size in terms of the number of parameters, with three points that likely correspond to the sizes of the models being compared. The y-axes represent performance as a percentage, which could mean accuracy, precision, recall, or another relevant performance metric depending on the specific task. The graphs appear to show that Mistral performs better than LLaMA-2 and the Size 7B model across all metrics. This indicates that within the context of these measurements and tasks, Mistral is a stronger model. The exact nature of the tasks or what “MLM U”, “Reasoning”, “Knowledge”, and “Commonsense” specifically refer to are not detailed in the image, but they likely correspond to standard NLP tasks designed to test understanding of language, ability to reason, knowledge recall, and commonsense reasoning, respectively.

Each graph shows performance as a function of model size (in terms of billion parameters). Identify Relevant Data: We need to focus on the Mistral and Llama 2 models across all four graphs to extract the relevant data. For mAP@L: — Llama 2 reaches above 65% when reaching 70 billion parameters. — Mistral starts at around 5 billion parameters with about 48% and reaches almost 65% by the time it gets to 34 billion parameters. For Reason@L: — Llama 2 reaches about 68% when reaching 70 billion parameters. — Mistral starts at around 5 billion parameters with about 52% and reaches almost 68% by the time it gets to 34 billion parameters. For Knowledge@L: — Llama 2 starts at about 45% with 1.3 billion parameters and reaches just slightly under 60% by 70 billion parameters. — Mistral is not plotted in this graph, so no direct comparison can be made. For Comprehension@L: — Llama 2 starts just above 40% with 1.3 billion parameters and reaches just under 60% by 70 billion parameters. — Mistral starts around 13 billion parameters with about 52% and continues above 62% by 34 billion parameters. Evaluate: From the graphs, we can see that Mistral and Llama 2 are very comparable in performance in the metrics where both are shown. However, Mistral is not displayed on the Knowledge@L graph, so no comparison can be made for that particular metric. Draw a Conclusion: In the graphs where both models can be compared (mAP@L, Reason@L, and Comprehension@L), Mistral appears to perform comparably to Llama 2, reaching similar levels of performance at smaller parameter sizes relative to the plotted sizes for Llama 2. This suggests that Mistral could be more parameter-efficient. However, since there is no data for Mistral in the Knowledge@L graph, we cannot draw a complete comparison\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch2\u003eObservation:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is a hallucination with a number of model parameters and percentage points though the final conclusion is partially correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1\u003eImage 3 — Performances of different LLMs across various NLP tasks.\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/images/1*EdZACHs8CZEtduO1Y7e3Qw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"239\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch1\u003eGeneral Question:\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion:\u003c/strong\u003e Analyze the Image.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnswer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"0b3d\" class=\"oh oi po oj b ok pf om on oo pg oq or os ph ou ov ow pi oy oz pa pj pc pd pe gm bj\"\u003eThe image appears to be a table containing numerical data, which seems to be a comparative analysis of various models across multiple parameters or tests. Each row represents a different model or configuration as indicated by names such as “MPT” and “Falcon” followed by a size specification like “70B,” “7B,” or some other parameter. The columns are labeled with test names or evaluation metrics, such as “Size,” “Avg,” “AQuA-RAT,” “LogiQA,” “L-SAT-AR,” “L-SAT-IC,” “L-SAT-RC,” “SAT-en (w/o Psg.),” and “SAT-math.” The data is likely related to performance scores of these models on these tests, where higher numbers probably indicate better performance. Without additional context, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis of this data, but it seems clear that it is intended to provide a performance comparison between different models on various tasks, possibly in the field of machine learning or artificial intelligence evaluations, where such models are typically assessed on reasoning, comprehension, or problem-solving capabilities. The “70B” and “7B” demarcations could refer to the size of the model in terms of the number of parameters, commonly used in assessing language models.
