class="BlogPost_htmlPost__Z5oDL"><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">When we talk about LlamaIndex, we’re actually referring to an ecosystem consisting of more than 650 Python packages, mostly <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/community/integrations/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">Integrations</a> and <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/community/llama_packs/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">Packs</a>. All these packages share a single GitHub repository, what engineers fondly call a “monorepo”. In this article, we’re going to introduce <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">LlamaDev</code>, our new tool for managing monorepos at scale, and explain the challenges we ran into with existing tooling to get us to this point.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">The challenge: 650+ dependency trees</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Each Python package in the monorepo is published on <a href="https://pypi.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">PyPI</a> and comes with its own <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pyproject.toml</code> file. For those not familiar with the ecosystem, a <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pyproject.toml</code> file for a modern Python package is a one stop shop defining several aspects of the package lifecycle: its dependencies, its release version number, the Python and operating system versions supported, and how tools like linters and type checkers should behave with that specific package. Most packages have tests, and some have an additional list of development dependencies.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Integrations and Packs have some code in common, shipped through a foundational package called <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-index-core</code> that pretty much every package in the ecosystem depends on. Additionally, they can depend on each other, for example <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-index-llms-azure-openai</code> requires <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-index-llms-openai</code> to work. As you can imagine, this has a few implications for the testing strategy, such as:</p><ul><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">If we touch <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-index-core</code> in a pull request, tests for most of the packages in the monorepo need to be triggered to ensure they keep working after that change</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">If we touch something like <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-index-llms-openai</code>, we need to find which are the packages depending on it and test them to ensure they still work</li></ul><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Developing is easy(ish)</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">The experience of developing in one of these packages varies. Sometimes we work on a single, self-contained Integration with no additional LlamaIndex dependencies other than <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-index-core</code>. That’s the happy path, where we test our code against a certain version of the core package and if it works, it works.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Sometimes we work on a package that has dependents in the monorepo. In this case, we need to ensure our changes work for the package itself without disrupting other packages. Sometimes we work on the core package, where we need to be extra careful not to introduce breaking changes that might impact the whole monorepo.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Last but not least, we do our best to support multiple Python and operating system versions in our packages, which for the vast majority means Python 3.9 all the way up to 3.12+ on three operating systems: Windows, Mac and Linux.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Maintaining is hard</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">The first thing you want in a monorepo is consistency. Even a slight difference in the way tests are executed or packages are built can complicate cross-platform support and turn batch operations across the monorepo into a nightmare. The risk of ending up with 650+ <em>slightly</em> different packages is very high, specially in the Python ecosystem, so the first tool we brought in was a Python project manager.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">A Python project manager usually relies on the <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pyproject.toml</code> file to provide features like building and publishing a package, managing dependencies and lockfiles, defining scripts and automation tasks, preparing virtual environments to work on the code in isolation with different version of Python.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">First iteration: Poetry for individual packages</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Our tool of choice was <a href="https://python-poetry.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">Poetry</a>: feature complete, very well established in the Python community, it served us well for <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/8049" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">over than a year</a>. Working with Poetry on a single package is a breeze: with its expressive command line interface it can set up specific Python versions and build virtual environments, so that running the tests while iterating on the code becomes very easy. But don’t get too excited: we work on a monorepo, where even the easiest things become complex.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">While Poetry is great to work in isolation on a single package, it doesn’t really know about package dependencies. For example, it cannot know that a certain package depending on us actually sits in a sibling directory of the same git repository. Being in the same repository, we could easily trigger the tests to verify that our changes upstream didn’t break the dependents, but Poetry just doesn’t have the information to do this.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">First iteration: Pants for build management</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">And thus we had to introduce another tool: we needed a build system, preferably designed to explicitly work within a monorepo. A build system is a piece of software that automates the process of building source code into artifacts, taking care of all the intermediate steps. For a Python codebase, this means to set up a virtual environment for a certain Python version, fetch and install dependencies, run the tests, build the wheel packages, and optionally to publish them to some global registry like PyPI.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">We chose <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">Pants</a> for the job, and again it served us well for <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/10537" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">more than one year</a>. Pants explicitly supports Python projects and is particularly smart in detecting which tests to trigger across multiple packages in the monorepo when the upstream has changed. It also comes with a powerful caching system that can sensibly speed up the setup of each build environment.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Version 1.0 worked for a year</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">To recap, for well over a year this was the tech stack used in the LlamaIndex monorepo:</p><ul><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Poetry to manage the single Python projects.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Pants to orchestrate testing across different packages (we didn’t use the build features).</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Github actions to automate Pants and Poetry runs on pull requests and git pushes.</li></ul><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Our setup was working, but admittedly had a few minor flaws. The problem with minor flaws is that they tend to become less and less minor as the system scales. A one-second operation on a single package doesn’t seem much, until you have to repeat it 650 times and now an automated job takes 10 minutes.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Problems of scale: build speeds and caching servers</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Let’s start with Poetry. The tool works pretty well and we could express sophisticated dependency requirements, but the dependency solver can be very slow at times. Add it to the fact that <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pip</code> is the only installer available, and the overhead working on a package can be measured in seconds. Again, you won’t probably notice working on a single package, but without Pants caching virtual environments, an extensive run of unit tests on the monorepo could take a very long time.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Speaking of Pants, it came with its own set of flaws. The first one we encountered was setup: while defining targets and dependencies is a hell of a task, but at least something you do once then profit, the caching system was more demanding. We had to host a service on AWS behind a public address so it could be used from Github workflows. And the caching server is not something you deploy once and forget. We had to scale it up a couple of times, add two redundant instances behind a load balancer, resize storage a couple of times. Sometimes Github workflows failed with weird errors, only to find out later that the caching server was unresponsive or behaving erratically. All understandable, but given the size of our team, it was expensive to maintain in terms of resources and money.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Problems of control: logging, inconsistency and more</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">And that’s not all: Pants’ sophisticated caching comes with an additional price. The Python virtual environments used during a build are managed by Pants internally with <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pip</code>. You don’t have much control over it, the environments are not easily accessible, and this has a few implications.</p><ul><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">First of all, Pants understands and can rely on Poetry configurations, but it doesn’t invoke it directly. This means a test run in the CI is different from a test run invoked locally with Poetry.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Second, Pants logging is really verbose, and messages related to installation or dependency problems are not easy to find and debug. Depending on the type of the error, at times even tests failures can be hard to find in the logs.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Lastly, running Pants locally is not easy and we don’t ask contributors to do that, but this means sometimes pull requests show failures that cannot be reproduced locally, making the developer experience quite poor.</li></ul><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Why we needed version 2.0</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">To recap, these are the problems we were facing as the size of the monorepo increased:</p><ul><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Slow iterations due to dependency management struggles.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Maintaining the build system was a burden.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Debugging CI runs was hard.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Contributing to the project was hard.</li></ul><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Looking back at our past Slack conversations, it’s been a while since we started fiddling with the idea of replacing <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pip</code> with <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">uv</code> to take advantage of its huge speedups at install time, but we only recently had time available to make a serious attempt. Here’s what happened.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Migrating projects to uv from Poetry</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">The original task was quite vague, it essentially read something like “use <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">uv</code> everywhere so we can to shorten the CI feedback loop”. We didn’t want to get rid of existing tooling, just introduce a new one that looked promising.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Pants has a section in the docs <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/dev/reference/targets/uv_requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">mentioning uv</a>, so we were optimistic there could be a way to make the two coexist. That optimism lasted about a hour, the time needed to go through the docs, browse some threads in the Pants Discord server and realize that no, Pants cannot use <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">uv</code> instead of <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pip</code> internally. There’s a third-party <a href="https://github.com/TechnologyBrewery/pants-uv-lifecycle-plugin" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">plugin</a> that does that, but we didn’t want to add another layer of complexity on something that we already barely controlled, so we canned that idea.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Plan B: we could still call <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">uv</code> within the Poetry projects, so at least we would speed up local development, no? No. <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/8978" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">Poetry doesn’t support uv</a> and it won’t in the foreseeable future. Luckily uv is much more than a replacement for <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pip</code>, it’s actually a very powerful Python project manager. So we took it for a spin and migrated a few packages to see what changes would be required. This got off to a very good start. If you have uv installed, migrating a package is literally one command you run on the folder containing the <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pyproject.toml</code> file:</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">uvx migrate-to-uv<br/></p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">We won’t say we were impressed by how fast it was to install dependencies for a package, because that was expected. What we fell in love with was everything else: uv is simple, tidy, expressive. <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">uv run --</code> is so powerful you won’t need to <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">activate</code> a virtual environment in your life ever again. Some of us, Homebrew hardcore users, let a Python project manager tool install a Python distribution for the first time ever. It didn’t take us very long to make the call and say goodbye to Poetry. If the developer experience was so good for us, contributors would certainly appreciate.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">How to manage builds in 2.0?</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Still we weren’t happy. The CI still wouldn&#x27;t benefit from uv and contributors would still have to struggle with cryptic failures in pull request checks. Something was itching, and you don’t work on something like LlamaIndex if you don’t scratch. So we scratched.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">We are not so crazy to think we could rewrite something like Pants and replace it, but we were only using about 20% of Pants features, and we definitely are more than 20% crazy. So we rewrote the code detecting the dependency graphs of all the packages in the monorepo, relying on the <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pyproject.toml</code> files alone. On top of that, we added some code to detect what packages should be tested in every pull request, given the files that were changed. Then some code to invoke <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">pytest</code> and grab only the logs that matter. Then some logic to avoid failing the CI jobs with untestable packages or unrelated failures. Then we decided all this code <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/18615" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">could be turned into a custom made tool</a>.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Introducing LlamaDev</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">We’ve called our new tool LlamaDev and any contributor can run it from a clone of the monorepo with <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">uv run llama-dev</code>.</p><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">The list of improvements we introduced since <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/18524" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">we switched from Poetry+Pants to uv+LlamaDev</a> is long:</p><ul><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Average time for a complete test run (without computing coverage) of all 600+ packages is about 20% faster, corresponding to about 6 minutes less.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Depending on the specific package, partial test runs are even faster. For example, changing an integration with many dependants like <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-index-llms-openai</code> went from about <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/actions/runs/14499185118" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">11 minutes</a> down <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/actions/runs/15098703255" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">to 4</a>.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Logs are much clearer now, and contributors can see exactly what happened if a check failed.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Contributors can run <code class="SanityPortableText_inlineCode__cI85z">llama-dev</code> locally and reproduce exactly what was done in the CI system if some debugging is needed.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Lockfiles are now checked into the repository for better build reproducibility.</li><li class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">We don’t rely anymore on external resources, all the computing needed is on Github actions.</li></ul><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">And this obviously goes on top of everything uv does to improve the day-to-day when working on any Python project.</p><h2 class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-48__A2f8Q">Now you can easily work on LlamaIndex and LlamaDev</h2><p class="Text_text__zPO0D Text_text-size-16__PkjFu">Since we switched to uv+LlamaDev, we introduced a few optimizations like <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/.github/workflows/unit_test.yml#L30" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">using a uv cache</a> and added several <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/18734" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">new features</a> to LlamaDev, but we can do much more with your help. If you ever wanted to contribute to LlamaIndex, this is the right time to begin because <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="SanityPortableText_link__QA4Ze">onboarding has never been easier</a>.
